## **1. Executive Summary** <a name='exuctive summary'></a>


This project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease risk, enabling early diagnosis, optimized healthcare resource allocation, and improved patient outcomes. By analyzing patient demographics and clinical data, the model achieves 75% accuracy and a strong ROC-AUC score of 0.83, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing high-risk individuals. Further refinements can enhance recall, reducing false negatives to ensure that at-risk patients receive timely medical intervention.

**Problem Statement**

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for millions of deaths annually. Early detection is critical to preventing severe complications, but traditional diagnostic methods are resource-intensive and often reactive rather than proactive. This project seeks to develop a predictive machine learning model to identify high-risk individuals before symptoms escalate, reducing medical costs and improving patient outcomes.

**Solution Approach**

Using clinical and demographic data, we developed a Logistic Regression model to classify patients based on heart disease risk. The model was trained on five key patient features—age, sex, max heart rate, angina level, and non-anginal pain. The dataset was preprocessed with feature encoding, scaling, and categorical transformations to ensure robust model performance. Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix analysis.

**Key Results**
	•	Accuracy: 75% - The model correctly classifies three out of four patients.
	•	ROC-AUC Score: 0.83 - Strong predictive capability in distinguishing heart disease cases.
	•	Recall for Heart Disease: 71% - Captures most high-risk patients but misses 29% of true cases (False Negatives).
	•	Confusion Matrix: 8 heart disease cases were misclassified as healthy, which could lead to missed early interventions.

**Recommendations**

1. Increase Recall for Heart Disease Detection
	•	Adjust the classification threshold to prioritize sensitivity, minimizing false negatives.

2. Incorporate Additional Clinical Features
	•	Include cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and family history to improve model accuracy.

3. Explore More Advanced Models
	•	Consider Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to enhance precision and recall balance.

4. Deploy as a Screening Tool for Early Diagnosis
	•	Integrate this model into hospital decision systems to assist physicians in risk assessment.


This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven predictive analytics in transforming healthcare by identifying heart disease risk early and accurately. The current model provides a strong baseline, with opportunities to fine-tune its sensitivity and expand its feature set for even better real-world applicability. With further optimization, this approach could significantly enhance preventive healthcare and save lives.
